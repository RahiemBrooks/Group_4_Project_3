# Group_4_Project_3
Our team, Group 4, successfully met all the requirements for Project 3. Our visualization incorporates a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite as the database. To enhance our project, we incorporated web scraping and utilized the Leaflet library. Additionally, we stepped beyond the materials covered in class by using React to create a database. We merged and cleaned two Excel spreadsheets using pandas and exported a CSV file, which we utilized for our visualizations. Our datasets were collected from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ensuring that our project is backed by reliable and authoritative data sources.

Using comprehensive datasets from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and web scraping of job platforms such as Indeed and Simply, our research project has successfully analyzed and presented crucial insights regarding data scientist employment and salaries in the United States. The findings are presented in a professional, technical, and scientific manner through easily understandable charts and visualizations.

The first dataset focuses on the total employment of data scientists by state, with figures rounded to the nearest 10, excluding self-employed individuals. The corresponding chart, represented by shades of green, illustrates the distribution of available data scientist jobs across various states. It is evident that California and New York have the highest number of job opportunities, followed by Florida and Texas. Notably, Arkansas lacks statistical data in this regard.

To further emphasize the variance in employment levels, a scatterplot showcases the gaps between states' data scientist employment. The bright yellow dot representing California, the home of Silicon Valley, stands out as a leader in generating data scientist jobs. New York and Texas also emerge as outliers in terms of employment opportunities. Several other states grouped together, marked by purple dots, reflect a strong correlation in their data scientist employment figures.

The next dataset examines the distribution of data scientist employment by industry. The Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services industry emerges as the top employer of data scientists. This industry encompasses a wide range of professional services, including legal, accounting, engineering, research and development, and consulting. It involves businesses that provide specialized knowledge and expertise to clients or customers. On the other hand, Credit Intermediation and Related Activities ranks tenth in the list of top industries hiring data scientists. This industry primarily focuses on lending, borrowing, and facilitating the flow of funds between borrowers and lenders, encompassing activities like commercial banking, credit unions, mortgage lending, and financial intermediaries.

To highlight these industry-specific employment trends, a scatterplot visually represents the hiring of data scientists across different sectors. The professional, scientific, and technical services industry exhibits the highest number of available data scientist jobs. Although credit intermediation and related activities rank lower, they still secure a place among the top ten industries hiring data scientists.

Furthermore, our research project delves into the most in-demand skills requested by employers for data scientist roles. According to job descriptions on Indeed, the top ten skills sought after in 2023 are Python, SQL, R, TensorFlow, AWS, Tableau, Spark, PyTorch, Azure, and Java. Proficiency in programming languages like Python, R, and SQL, along with statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, data cleaning and preprocessing, domain knowledge, and effective communication are vital for success as a data scientist. These skills enable data scientists to extract insights, build predictive models, optimize processes, make data-driven decisions, identify patterns, and solve complex problems within organizations.

Additionally, our project explores the top ten highest salaries offered by industries hiring data scientists. The technology industry consistently offers the highest salaries, with renowned companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft being notable contributors. The finance industry, healthcare industry, consulting industry, e-commerce industry, and energy industry also offer competitive salaries to data scientists due to their reliance on data analysis, decision-making, and optimization.

It is essential to acknowledge that salaries can vary based on factors such as experience, location, company size, and specific job responsibilities. Emerging industries such as artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles are also known for offering high salaries to data scientists as they leverage data for innovation and growth.

![INDUSTRY AND MEAN SALARY](https://github.com/RahiemBrooks/Group_4_Project_3/assets/135518113/e3413ae5-262e-4236-b96e-c6ed485d592f)

Lastly, our project presents mean salaries for data scientist jobs by state. The 25th and 75th percentiles provide insights into the salary range earned by data scientists in each state. The 25th percentile represents the lower end of the salary range, indicating that 25% of data scientists earn below this value, while the 75th percentile represents the higher end, with only 25% of data scientists earning above this value. Analyzing the spread between these two percentiles allows for an understanding of the salary distribution within a state. A wider spread suggests greater variability in salaries, indicating significant differences in earning potential among data scientists. Conversely, a narrower spread suggests a more consistent salary range within the state. It is crucial to consider factors such as experience, education, industry, company size, cost of living, and demand when interpreting these salary estimates.

In conclusion, our research project provides comprehensive insights into data scientist employment and salaries in the United States. The professional, technical, and scientific presentation of data through charts and visualizations facilitates a clear understanding of the distribution of jobs, industries, skills, and salaries within the field of data science.
