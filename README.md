Our team, Group 4, successfully met all the requirements for Project 3. Our visualization incorporates a Python Flask-powered API, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite as the database. To enhance our project, we incorporated web scraping and utilized the Leaflet library. Additionally, we stepped beyond the materials covered in class by using React to create a database. We merged and cleaned two Excel spreadsheets using pandas and exported a CSV file, which we utilized for our visualizations. Our datasets were collected from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, ensuring that our project is backed by reliable and authoritative data sources.

Using comprehensive datasets from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and web scraping of job platforms such as Indeed and Simply, our research project has successfully analyzed and presented crucial insights regarding data scientist employment and salaries in the United States. The findings are presented in a professional, technical, and scientific manner through easily understandable charts and visualizations.

Ladies and gentlemen, imagine a map of the United States before you, a vibrant and dynamic representation of data scientist employment. As we delve into this dataset, we uncover a fascinating story of opportunity and growth.

In shades of green, this chart reveals the total employment of data scientists by state. California and New York, like shining beacons, boast the highest number of job opportunities in this field. From the bustling tech hub of Silicon Valley to the thriving metropolis of New York City, these states are at the forefront of the data revolution. But let's not forget the rising stars - Florida and Texas - with their own vibrant data science communities. However, there's one state that remains a mystery, Arkansas, a hidden gem waiting to be explored.

Stepping beyond state boundaries, let's explore the industries driving this data revolution. The Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services industry takes center stage, offering a diverse range of services from legal counsel to engineering expertise. It's here that data scientists find a home, utilizing their skills to reshape the world. And while Credit Intermediation and Related Activities may rank lower among the top ten, it still plays a crucial role in facilitating the flow of funds and financial transactions.

This dataset examines the distribution of data scientist employment by industry. The Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services industry emerges as the top employer of data scientists. This industry encompasses a wide range of professional services, including legal, accounting, engineering, research and development, and consulting. It involves businesses that provide specialized knowledge and expertise to clients or customers. On the other hand, Credit Intermediation and Related Activities ranks tenth in the list of top industries hiring data scientists. This industry primarily focuses on lending, borrowing, and facilitating the flow of funds between borrowers and lenders, encompassing activities like commercial banking, credit unions, mortgage lending, and financial intermediaries.

To highlight these industry-specific employment trends, a scatterplot visually represents the hiring of data scientists across different sectors. The professional, scientific, and technical services industry exhibits the highest number of available data scientist jobs. Although credit intermediation and related activities rank lower, they still secure a place among the top ten industries hiring data scientists.

Now, let's zoom in on the skills that employers seek in their quest for data science talent. Python, SQL, R, and machine learning algorithms top the list, empowering data scientists to manipulate, analyze, and model data with precision. Visualization tools like Tableau or matplotlib allow them to transform complex information into compelling narratives. But it's not just technical prowess that matters; communication skills and domain knowledge are equally vital in translating data into actionable insights.

According to job descriptions on Indeed, the top ten skills sought after in 2023 are Python, SQL, R, TensorFlow, AWS, Tableau, Spark, PyTorch, Azure, and Java. Proficiency in programming languages like Python, R, and SQL, along with statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, data cleaning and preprocessing, domain knowledge, and effective communication are vital for success as a data scientist. These skills enable data scientists to extract insights, build predictive models, optimize processes, make data-driven decisions, identify patterns, and solve complex problems within organizations.

As we shift our focus to salaries, we uncover a world where data scientists are highly sought after and well-rewarded. The technology industry reigns supreme, with tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft offering top salaries to attract and retain the best talent. Finance, healthcare, consulting, e-commerce, and energy industries also recognize the value of data scientists, rewarding them handsomely for their expertise.

Our project explores the top ten highest salaries offered by industries hiring data scientists. The technology industry consistently offers the highest salaries, with renowned companies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft being notable contributors. The finance industry, healthcare industry, consulting industry, e-commerce industry, and energy industry also offer competitive salaries to data scientists due to their reliance on data analysis, decision-making, and optimization.

It is essential to acknowledge that salaries can vary based on factors such as experience, location, company size, and specific job responsibilities. Emerging industries such as artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles are also known for offering high salaries to data scientists as they leverage data for innovation and growth.

But what about the states themselves? The salary ranges for data scientists vary across the nation. The spread between the 25th and 75th percentiles gives us a glimpse into the distribution of salaries within each state. Some states exhibit a wider range, indicating significant differences in earning potential, while others boast a more consistent salary range.

Lastly, our project presents mean salaries for data scientist jobs by state. The 25th and 75th percentiles provide insights into the salary range earned by data scientists in each state. The 25th percentile represents the lower end of the salary range, indicating that 25% of data scientists earn below this value, while the 75th percentile represents the higher end, with only 25% of data scientists earning above this value. Analyzing the spread between these two percentiles allows for an understanding of the salary distribution within a state. A wider spread suggests greater variability in salaries, indicating significant differences in earning potential among data scientists. Conversely, a narrower spread suggests a more consistent salary range within the state. It is crucial to consider factors such as experience, education, industry, company size, cost of living, and demand when interpreting these salary estimates.
